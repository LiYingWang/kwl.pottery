# Hypotheses and expectations

# My hypothesis is that if foreign contacts including European and Chinese had impact on the emergence of social inequality in local indigenous society due to the monopolies for trade between a small number of indigenous people, then I expect to see the changes in social organization from a more corporate to a more network organization that can be reflected by pottery production at Kiwulan. The emergence of craft specialization, here pottery specialization, are usually related to the presence of elite control. In this case, if the competitions for foreign resources and being trade partners of European or Chinese colonizer among individuals gradually lead to the emergence of social inequality, then I expect the local pottery will show more homogeneous features after contact due to the pottery specialization caused by control of small group of individuals.
