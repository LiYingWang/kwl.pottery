  The emergence of ceramic specialization in prehistoric societies is often linked to shifts in the complexity of social structures, because specialized pottery production can reflect craft specialization and the presence of elite control. Previous work on identifying specialization relies on typological or linear metric analysis. Here we demonstrate how to investigate ceramic standardization by analyzing outlines of ceramic vessels. Outline analysis is an important method because, unlike more commonly-used landmark analysis methods, it can effectively quantify shape differences for objects that lack distinctive measurement points needed for landmark analysis. We demonstrate this method using pottery from Kiwulan, a large multi-component Iron Age site (AD 1350-1850) in northeast Taiwan. To measure ceramic specialization, we quantified pottery standardization by analyzing shape variables with reproducible geometric morphometric methods. We computed coefficients of variation (CVs) for shape coefficients obtained by elliptical Fourier analysis to test for shape standardization. We found significant differences in pottery shape and shape standardization that indicate changes in pottery production resulting from contact with mainland Han Chinese groups in northeast Taiwan. We infer increasing craft specialization and changes in social organization. Our case study, which includes an openly available research compendium of R code, represents an innovative application of outline-based methods in geometric morphometry to answer the anthropological questions of craft specialization. This study implies that craft specialization can be a deliberate act of resistance to show indigenous identity and ethnicity in a direct culture contact situation.

# Introduction

The development of craft specialization is sometimes associated with social changes since it reflects changes in production systems that could inform on the social, economic, or political conditions of a society. We define specialization as "differential participation in specific economic activities", in which a particular good is produced by fewer producers compared to the total population who consume it [@Costin1991; @Costin2001, pp. 43]. The effects of the emergence of specialization in past societies on their social structures and social processes is an important question in archaeological investigations of small scale societies in the Late Holocene. Considered through a political lens, craft specialization may be a strategy used by elites to control production systems to maintain their power and authority [@Costin2001]. This relationship between craft specialization and social differentiation has been broadly discussed, and many cases show that increasingly specialized production can be a useful indicator of increasing socio-political complexity [@Hirshman2010; @Junker1999]. That said, more economic focus considers production, exchange, and consumption as a whole to explain specialization as part of a strategy to accommodate uneven distributions of resources [@Costin2001; @Arnold1994]. Craft specialisation may appear as a reaction to changes in subsistence practices [@Stark1995economic], or as a result of long-distance trade and inter-regional exchange [@Alizadeh2018]. Present-day investigation of ceramic specialization in the Jodhpur region of India suggests that the adoption of standardized products across cultural boundaries is a reaction to a collapse of previous economic system, indicating a correlation with major socio-economic changes [@Roux2015]. However, it is important to note that explanations for the emergence of specialized production in past societies might not be so straightforward or singular. @Acabado2018's case study in lowland northern Philippines shows that specialization is not necessarily accompanied with social differentiation based on a low degree of ceramic specialization in Ifugao ranked societies during the time of Spanish colonization. The development of specialization could be dependent on unique historical factors, where the conditions and contexts under which specialists organized must be taken into account when making inferences about changes in social organization [@Roux2015; @Costin2001].

The emergence of social inequality in the context of cross-cultural interaction, especially in a colonial situation, has been observed in many parts of world, for example, when foreign trade goods are introduced to local Indigenous societies. The monopolization of long-distance trade goods has caused substantial transformations of Indigenous economic, cultural, and socio-political systems [@Dietler2005; @Dietler1997; @Junker1993; @Silliman2005]. Pericolonial archaeology is the study of these indirect effects of colonialism, investigating areas where European colonial rule was limited and their conquests were short-lived and unsuccessful, but their colonial activities had economic and political impacts on Indigenous peoples living on the periphery of colonial control and influence [@Trabert2017; @Acabado2017]. @Acabado2017's study of Ifugao society in the  Philippines highland suggests economic and political intensification during the Spanish presence as the response of Indigenous peoples to the Spanish cooptation. Indigenous societies might not simply passively accept colonial rule, but instead actively negotiate with the colonist, and accommodate or resist foreign intrusion through their daily cultural practices, such as their consumption patterns of foreign goods [@Dietler2015; @Given2004; @Mullins2011; @Scaramelli2005; @Silliman2001; @TorrenceandClarke2000]. In this paper we present a case study from Northeastern Taiwan as an example of these indirect impacts of foreign occupations on local Indigenous societies. Our aim is to investigate if there was increasing ceramic specialization resulting from Indigenous interaction with Europeans in the 17th century or Chinese in the 19th century, two major foreign influences in early historical Taiwan, that might indicate social changes in local indigenous societies. Previous reports of archaeological evidence in northeastern Taiwan descrbes increases in the use of prestige goods, such as trade ornaments, and uneven artefact distribution patterns in domestic areas and burial contexts at the time when the Indigenous communities encountered the Spanish and the Dutch in the 17th century. Here we show that in addition to the differential distribution of trade ornaments post-European contact, the locally-made ceramics become highly consistent in their form and shape, compared to other pottery throughout northeastern Taiwan. This shift to higher consistency hints at the possibility of craft specialization in pottery manufacture. 

To identify craft specialization in the archaeological record, variation in the standardization of a specialized product is often used as an indicator. This is based on the assumption that specialized mass production will lead to uniformity of the product due to routinization, higher skills, and fewer producers involved in production [@Stark1995; @Costin1991; @Costin2001]. For investigating ceramic standardization, several measurements have been discussed and used, such as metric, compositional, and technological approaches [@Arnold2000; @Boness2015; @Rice1991; @Blackman1993; @Costin1991; @Tite1999; @Roux2015]. Among those variables, metric measurements are most widely applied to archaeological assemblages because of the ease of collecting these data. By comparing variations for sets of data using coefficient of variation coupled with statistical testing, the degree of standardization can be identified according to values [@Eerkens2001; @Roux2003; @Stark1995]. @Roux2018's ethnographic study in the Jodhpur region of India suggests the number of artisans can be statistically assessed by comparing coefficients of variation of linear dimensions of pots, and differences between artisans can be detected at both intra-individual level and inter-individual level in a region. However, because pottery vessels are typically have curved shapes, linear measurements have limited sensitivity to many kinds of shape variations. Thus, to capture subtle shape variations that might be relevant to standardization, a method that is senstive to non-linear aspects of shape variation is necessary. Here we analyse pottery shape using geometric morphometric methods, a new approach for measuring the degree of standardization because it takes a statistical summary of the overall shape as variable for comparison [@Slice2007]. Using geometric morphometry, we study shape and standardization of locally made ceramics at Kiwulan (1350-1950 AD) [@Chen2007], a large multi-component archaeological site in northeastern Taiwan, to identify changes in ceramic production resulting from cross-cultural interaction contexts. 

Our hypothesis is that if foreign influences had impacts on the emergence of social inequality in local Indigenous society due to monopolies of trade arising among a small number of Indigenous people, then we expect to see changes in social organization from a more corporate to a more network organization [@Feinman2000]. We expect this corporate-network shift to manifest as increased specialization pottery manufacture, indicated archaeologically by icreased standardisation of pottery production at Kiwulan. The emergence of craft specialization, here pottery specialization, is often related to changes in social organization towards a society with increasing status inequality. In this case, if the competition among Indigenous individual for foreign resources and trade partnership with European or Chinese colonizers gradually lead to increasing social inequality, then we expect the local ceramics will show more homogeneous shapes after contact due to the emergence of craft specialization caused by rgreater economic and social control by a small group of individuals at Kiwulan. Our results are important for understanding the indirect influences of  European colonists on local Indigenous societies, which remains unclear in East Asia where colonial power had limited success compared to other places in Southeast Asia. Our findings improve our understanding of the relationship between the use of prestige goods, the degree of ceramic specialization, and the influence of foreign colonizers in a pericolonial context [cf. @Acabado2017]. 

## Geometric Morphometry

Geometric morphometric methods (GMM) has been increasingly applied in archaeology for shape analysis, which explores morphological variability and similarity of archaeological materials to address the questions of anthropological interest. Geometric morphometrics differs from traditional linear measurements through its use of Cartesian coordinates of morphological structures to define shapes [@Adams2004; @Bookstein1997; @Lawing2010; @Slice2007]. Landmarks, curves or outlines of objects can be represented by coordinates in terms of their unique point locations with respect to numerical values on coordinate axes. There are two common morphometric methods: landmark approaches and outline approaches [@Adams2004]. Landmark approaches assign a set of landmarks or semilandmarks onto objects as reference points that can be specified on a coordinate system as xy coordinates for two dimensions, or xyz coordinates for three dimensions. In a typical analysis, starting with raw landmarks, a sample of objects are translated to a common centroid, rescaled into the same size, and rotated until the summed squared distances between corresponding landmarks are minimized using generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) [@Bookstein1991]. GPA is a method that superimposes sets of landmark configurations into a common coordinate system, where superimposed landmark coordinates are used as shape variables for further multivariate statistical analyses [@Slice2007]. Landmark-based morphometrics are widely applied to archaeological objects with obvious morphological features that can provide unambiguous reference points for landmark placement, such as projectile point tips or biological measurements points indicating osteological features [@Birch2019; @Buchanan2019; @Lycett2013; @Cardillo2010; @Haruda2019; @Meloro2015]. 

However, one limitation of landmark approaches is that landmarks may not be able to capture the shape differences of a morphological structure where the curving outlines between landmarks contains crucial variation. Furthermore, landmark points may be unavailable for structures that are mostly or entirely curves. In those cases, outline approaches are more suitable for analyzing the overall shape of an object. One outline approache is the semi-landmarks method, also called sliding landmarks, which assigns points along the curve between two landmarks at defined intervals [@Bookstein1997; @Lawing2010]. Those semi-landmarks are allowed to slide along the curve to remove the effect of the arbitrary landmark spacing by minimizing either Procrustes distance or bending energy [@Bookstein1997; @Slice2007; @Gunz2013]. Another approach that is commonly applied to two-dimensional closed shapes is elliptic Fourier Analysis (EFA), that converts coordinates along a curve into Fourier function coefficients, called harmonic coefficients [@Kuhl1982]. EFA uses periodic functions to capture geometric information, where an outline is decomposed into a series of ellipses described by trigonometric functions [@Adams2004; @Claude2008; @Bonhomme2014]. The number of harmonics determines the quality and precision of the geometric representation of an object. The harmonic power, a cumulated sum of squared harmonic coefficients, provides a robust rule for determining the desired number of harmonics [@Bonhomme2014]. 

EFA is suitable for shapes lacking representative landmarks or where curves contain the most meaningful variation. Applications in archaeology include human remains and zooarchaeology to understand  biological variation, and more recently on stone artifacts to explore stone tool technology [@Fox2015; @Hoggard2019; @Iovictua2010]. Ceramics is another archaeological materials that outline approaches can provide new insights into shape variation to answer anthropological questions related to ceramic specialization. Using semi-landmarks method, @Topi2018 examine 89 photographs of globular jars from the Casas Grandes of northwest Mexico. Their results suggest that some ceramic types from the Medio period (AD 1200-1450), were made by specialists based on highly standardized shapes. Among those highly standardized jars, some were made by attached specialists <!-- what does this mean, 'attached' to what? please clarify -->, while others were made by independent specialists according to their spatial distribution patterns. Similarity, @Selden2019 examined 28 Caddo bottle excavated at several sites (AD 500-1700) in northwest Louisiana <!-- using semi-landmarks or something else? please add -->. The results indicate a significant integration between the different parts of the bottles including rim, neck, body, and base that vary in a coordinated manner. Also, two discrete base and body shapes represented northern and southern differences were identified. For the EFA method, @Wilczek2014 evaluate the concordance between EFA and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and a traditional typology by studying 154 complete ceramic vessels with varied shapes from the Bibracte oppidum in France. The results show the variation indicated by EFA and DCT matches the traditional ceramic typology, which supports that claim that outline-based approaches can be efficiently used for studying variations in ceramic shapes. Furthermore, @Wilczek201's EFA results help us understand the level of production standardization over time across the region. Those examples show that outline approaches can distinguish variation in ceramic shapes at high resolutions to understand ceramic production. 

Taking the ceramics data from Kiwulan, northeastern Taiwan, we use EFA to evaluate the level of standardization of ceramics in relation to the European presence in the 17th century to get insights into the emergence of ceramic specialization. We use a significance test for the equality of coefficient of variations of shape variables to statistically compare the vessel standarization from different periods. Using pottery shape as a proxy to study craft specialization, we address these questions: Did foreign influence have impacts on indigenous pottery production that can be detected in the shape of the vessels? Did pottery shape become more homogeneous and standardized after foreign contacts with European colonizers or Chinese immigrants? 

# Archaeological background and materials 

Ceramics analyzed in this paper come from 40 units (4m by 4m) sampled from the central, undisturbed area of archaeological excavations at Kiwulan (Figure \@ref(fig:KWL-map); Figure \@ref(fig:KWL-sam-area)). Kiwulan is situated on a hill near a riverside at the northern margin of Yilan Province, which is characterized by a triangular alluvial plain facing eastwards the Pacific with high mountains on three other sides. Yilan is an ideal context to study peripheral colonial influence because Indigenous communities there were isolated by natural barriers that limited the frequency of direct contact with the Spanish and the Dutch settlers in northern Taiwan. The chronology of the archaeological deposits at Kiwulan consists of two cultural components, the upper component and the lower component, with a sterile layer in between [@Chen2007]. This paper focuses on the upper component, dated from AD 1350 to AD 1950, covering the late Iron Age and the historical period, which we define as the European presence in Taiwan in the early 17th century. The Dutch first occupied southern Taiwan in 1624 and then the Spanish occupied northern Taiwan in 1626 <!-- add citation for these dates -->. In 1642, the Spanish was expelled by the Dutch in northern Taiwan, who took over their forts at Helping Dau in Keelung, and in Tamsui. Since then, western Taiwan was mostly under Dutch colonial rule until 1662 when the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan was founded by Koxinga, a loyalist of the Ming dynasty of China [@Andrade2007]. 

The archaeological record of Kiwulan's upper component shows traces of foreign contacts, including Europeans in the 17th century, and waves of Chinese immigrants in the 19th century. Imported ceramics from mainland China, stoneware, and ornaments such as beads have been found in the upper component, indicating frequent long-distance trade activities in the 17th century during the European presence in northern Taiwan. In addition to artifacts, archaeological features such as burials, middens, and post-holes with _in-situ_ posts are widespread across  the 1-2 m thick deposit of the upper component, and demonstrate that Kiwulan was a continuously occupied large settlement site [@Chen2007]. To compare different foreign influences, we classified the upper component into three chronological phases: the pre-European, European, and Chinese periods. We identified these phases using 32 previously published radiocarbon ages <!-- add citaion to report with dates -->, excavation depth measurements, stratigraphic details reported by the excavators (colour, disturbance, etc.), and finds of chronologically diagnostic artifacts, such as blue and white porcelains, light grey glazed jars, and large dark brown glazed stoneware jars commonly used in the 17th century, and bricks and tiles used by the Chinese in the 19th century [@Hsieh2009; @Wang2011]. The deposit shows signs of continuous human occupation during each of the three phases across the sampling area.

The most abundant artefacts in the upper component are locally made ceramics, which are distributed throughout the sequence and across the site. More than 550,000 sherds were excavated, and around 1,200 vessels could be reconstructed. There are only two forms of local vessels, a cooking pot and a steamer made of two cooking pots stacked together with a clay filter layer in between. Those pots forms show high consistency in shape. They have a globular body with a short neck and wide mouth. The exterior surface below the neck is decorated with a wide variety of impressed geometric motifs. These vessels were probably used for cooking, with evidence of charred residues and carbon deposits frequently observed on vessel interiors and soot on their exteriors. Moreover, a lack of evidence of other utilitarian earthenware ceramics suggests these globular pots were mainly used for daily cooking. They are fired to orange to brownish color with a fully oxidized core or a reduced core with oxidized fringes. Finger impressions and seams usually on the interior indicate they were pinched using slabs of clay and shaped by hand. This kind of pot has been widely found at archaeological sites during the late Iron Age and the historical period throughout the Yilan Plain.

Petrographic analysis for 34 thin sections shows high percentage of inclusions (15-50%), including argillite (15-40%), metasandstone (1-10%),  sandstone fragments (1-6%), quartz (1-5%), and trace amounts of feldspar and slate. The size of the particles ranges from 500 micron to 1300 micron. In general, the globular vessel farbric presents a mixture of fine, rounded argillite with a small part of rounded metasandstone and rounded to sub-angular monocrystalline quartz. The composition matches the mineralogical composition of local raw materials in the Yilan Plain [@Chen2016]. There is no substantial changes in the inclusions over time, indicating continuity in pottery fabric composition across the three periods.

```

# Methods

A total of `r total_no` largely intact vessels from pre-contact contexts (n = 32), post-European contexts (n = 27), and Chinese contact contexts (n = 14) were selected for ellipic Fourier analysis. Most of them cover every vessel component from rim to bottom. To fully explore the pottery standardization, we also take the metric measurements into account for comparison. The total of 362 reconstructed pots (pre-European = 153, European = 173, Chinese = 36) were measured. The metric attributes include thickness of rim, neck, and body, and diameter of rim, neck, and body. For each pot, two measurements for thickness and diameter were took to compute an average value. To obtain information about the pottery shape, we also compare the ratio of Rim/Body thickness, and the ratio of Rim/Body diameter. 

## Digitising and analysing by EFA

We used scanned pottery drawings acquired from Bureau of Cultural Affairs in Yilan. All drawings present a two-dimensional view of vessel cross-sections with indications of metric measurements. The scanned drawings were imported into Inkscape (http://inkscape.org) where outlines were traced manually. Where only half cross-section images were available, these were duplicated, flipped, and then joined with another one to create a 2D closed outline for each vessel. Geometric morphometric analyses were conducted using the R software [@Rlanguage2019] using the functions included in the Momocs, a R package intended to quantify and analyse shapes, especially for outline analysis [@Bonhomme2014]. The digitised outlines were converted into a list of successive x-y pixel coordinates for elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA), to investigate morphological differences among pottery shapes from our three occupation phases. The harmonic coefficients generated by EFA were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to illustrate the diversity of the shape data and identify major patterns of variation through . 

## Statistical analysis 

The principal component (PC) scores were analysed with a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test to identify significant differences in shapes between occupation phases. We also computed coefficients of variation values (CVs) for the PCs, treating the PCs as shape variables that are more informative than linear dimensions. The coefficient of variation is a common and widely-used statistical measure of the spread of a set of measurements of a sample. It is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean in a ratio scale format:

$$c_v = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}$$

By standardizing standard deviation in each data set, the coefficients of variation values allows us to directly compare variation in samples measured with different units or means. We take this as our measurement of standardisation in vessel shape: lower CV values reflect higher standardisation, and thus increased craft specialisation in the community. To answer the question of whether CV values for vessels samples across our three occupational phases are significantly different or not, we used the "Asymptotic test for the equality of coefficients of variation from k populations" [@Feltz1996], a significance test for CVs provided by the R package cvequality [@Marwick2019]. Our implementation is based on the following from @Feltz1996:

Let $s_i$ be the observed standard deviation of the $i$th sample (or group of measurements), $x_i$ be the observed mean of the $i$th sample, and let 

$$m_i=n_i-1$$

and we do not know the population $c_v$, so let $\widehat{\tau }_c$ be an estimate as follows:

$$\widehat{\tau }_c = \frac{\left( \sum _{j=1}^km_j\frac{S_j}{\bar{x}_j} \right)}{M}$$ 
where 
$$M=\sum _{j=1}^m m_j$$ 

Then the test statistic can be computed with: 

$$\begin{aligned} D'A D= \widehat{\tau }_c^{-2}\left( 0.5+\widehat{\tau }_c^2\right) ^{-1}\left[ \sum _{i=1}^km_i\left(\frac{s_i}{\bar{x}_i} \right)^2-\frac{\widehat{\tau }_c^2}{M} \right] \end{aligned}$$

The $D'AD$ value measures how far each sample $c_v$ is from our estimate of the population $c_v$. @Feltz1996 note that the $D'AD$ value distributes as a central $\chi^2$ random variable with $k-1$ degrees of freedom, from which a p-value can be computed.

# Results

To investigate the effect of the historically-documented decline of Indigenous population in the Chinese period <!-- add citation on population change during Chinese period --> on pottery production we examined the spatial distribution of pots in our sample in each period. Our concern is that the smaller population size during the Chinese period could confound our investigations into craft specialisation beause of reduced numbers of potters and pottery production shrinking a a few locations in the settlement during this time. Altough the overall number of vessels is smaller during the Chinese contact period, Figure \@ref(fig:pottery-spatial-pattern) shows that pottery is distributed randomly across the sampling area without any distinctive clusters. This suggests that differences in population across our three occupation phases are probably not driving variation in craft specialsation.

## Digitising and analysing by EFA

The scanned pottery drawings were acquired from Bureau of Cultural Affairs in Yilan. All drawing presents two-dimensional view of the section of a vessel with indications of metric measurements. The scanned drawings were imported into the Inkscape software for outlines tracing to remove additional information such as marks, lines, and measurements on the original drawings in order to obtain clear outline. Each traced half cross-section image was duplicated, flipped, and then joined with another one to create a 2D closed outline. Geometric morphometric analyses were conducted in the R software (www.rproject.org, Core-Team, 2015) using the functions included in the Momocs, a R package intended to quantify the shape and compare its variation, especially for outline analysis [@Bonhomme2014]. The digitised outlines were converted into a list of successive x-y pixel coordinates for elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA), which assesses morphological differences among pottery shapes from three occupation contexts. The harmonic coefficients generated by EFA were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) to illustrate the diversity of the shape data and identify the major patterns of variation through dimensionality reduction. 

## Statistical testing 

The principal components (PCs) scores were analysed with a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test for significant effects of the groups of occupation context on shape variances. Finally, we computed coefficients of variation statistic (CVs) among multiple groups of PCs with a significance test for the equality of CVs, which enable us to compare CVs in a statistical way [@Pearson1896]. The coefficient of variation is a common and widely-used statistical measure of the spread of a set of measurements of a sample. It is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean in a ratio scale format.

$$c_v = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}$$

By standardizing standard deviation in each data set, the coefficients of variation statistics allows us to directly compare variation in samples measured with different units or means. Although it is a useful method, there is a question that how should we make a decision that the differences among the multiple CVs are significant or not? To answer this question, we need convenient methods for testing the equality of $c_v$ values from different samples, which has been described in many publications and here we proposed a significant test for CVs using the R package cvequality [@Marwick2019] in the CRAN repository. The package cvequality includes two tests, the "Asymptotic test for the equality of coefficients of variation from k populations" [@Feltz1996] and the "Modified signed-likelihood ratio test (SLRT) for equality of CVs" [@Krishnamoorthy2014]. @Feltz1996 test is widely cited as an authoritative test for the equality of $c_v$ values that performs better than many approximative tests. It is a 'gold standard' test for comparing multiple $c_v$. Our implementation is based on the following from @Feltz1996:

Let $s_i$ be the observed standard deviation of the $i$th sample (or group of measurements), $x_i$ be the observed mean of the $i$th sample, and let 

$$m_i=n_i-1$$

and we do not know the population $c_v$, so let $\widehat{\tau }_c$ be an estimate as follows:

$$\widehat{\tau }_c = \frac{\left( \sum _{j=1}^km_j\frac{S_j}{\bar{x}_j} \right)}{M}$$ 
where 
$$M=\sum _{j=1}^m m_j$$ 
Then the test statistic can be computed with: 
$$\begin{aligned} D'A D= \widehat{\tau }_c^{-2}\left( 0.5+\widehat{\tau }_c^2\right) ^{-1}\left[ \sum _{i=1}^km_i\left(\frac{s_i}{\bar{x}_i} \right)^2-\frac{\widehat{\tau }_c^2}{M} \right] \end{aligned}$$
The $D'AD$ value measures how far each sample $c_v$ is from our estimate of the population $c_v$. @Feltz1996 note that the $D'AD$ value distributes as a central $\chi^2$ random variable with $k-1$ degrees of freedom, from which a p-value can be computed. We also include the @Krishnamoorthy2014 test as a more recent development with lower rates of type I error, better performance with uneven sample numbers, and more power across a range of conditions.

<!-- basic description of shape -->

The elliptic Fourier coefficients of `r total_no` pottery from three phases were calculated. Reliable pottery outlines were captured by 13 harmonics that gather 99% of the total harmonic power. The average shape of vessels from each phase was visualized by computing the mean of the standardized Fourier coefficients within each phase group (Figure \@ref(fig:EFA-analysis)). Figure \@ref(fig:thin-plate-splines) shows the shape changes described using thin-plate spline warping for paired periods, pre- and post-European periods, and post-European and Chinese periods.

<!-- further description of shape and differences between phases -->

The elliptic Fourier coefficients were examined by Principal Components Analysis to explore the shape variations across three phases. The first two principal components (PCs) explain `r vari_two`% of the total variances, of which `r pc1`% is explained by the first principle component. With the third component, the first three principal components explain `r vari_three`% of the total variance. Figure \@ref(fig:contribution-PCs) shows the shape variation associated with the first three principal components. PC1 captures the height of the vessels, from tall to short, and the roundness of the body from round to oval-shaped. PC2 relates to the neck and mouth constriction, from narrow to wide. PC3 explains a smaller portion of the variance (`r pc3`%), which relates to the degree of the flare of the neck, from curved to straight shape. The first two components account for most of the variance in relation to three phases (Figure \@ref(fig:first-two-PCs-byplot)). The results reflect a large overlap in shapes from three occupations phases, especially for shapes in the pre-European and post-European periods. However, the spread of shape distribution indicates a wider variation in shapes in the pre-European and post-European periods compared to those in the Chinese period along both PC1 and PC2 axes. In other words, we find a decrease in shape variance in the Chinese period that is evident in the shorter height and narrower mouth of vessels used in that period.

<!-- statistical test of difference in shape decsribed in previous paragraph -->

To test for differences in the distributions of shape variables indicated by the PC scores shown in Figure \ref(@fig:first-two-PCs-byplot)), we used a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test to compare pairwise combinations across our three occupation phases. Table \@ref(tab:MANOVA-table) shows significant differences in shape between Pre-European and Post-European phases (p = $`r pval_post_pre`$), and Pre-European and Chinese phases (p = $`r pval_chi_pre`$). Although there is considerable overlap of shape variables between the Pre-European and Post-European phases, their PC scores are significantly different from each other. There is little difference between vessel shapes in the Post-European and Chinese contact periods. 

```{r MANOVA-table}

<!-- CV equality testing -->
To compare pottery shape standardization across the three phases we  investigate the distributions of the first three PC scores, taking the PC scores as proxy variables for vessel shape (Figure \@ref(fig:PCs-distribution)). The first PC, vessel height, shows higher variation in the pre-European period compared to the Chinese period. That indicates that shape standardization was higher in the Chinese period compared to the pre-European period. The second PC also presents a similar pattern of higher shape standardization in the Chinese period compared to the other two phases. To see whether the differences in the distribution of PCs between any two phases are substantive or due to chance, we used a modified signed-likelihood ratio test to assess the equality of CVs. P-values for this significance test of CVs for PC1 and PC2 show significant differences in the standardization of vessel shapes across periods, especially between Chinese contact with either pre-European or post-European(Figure \@ref(fig:CV-test-PCs-plot), Table \@ref(tab:CV-test-PCs-table)). A significant difference is also detected between the pre-European and post-European periods.

# Discussion

Previous investigations at Kiwulan have suggested an unequal distribution of prestige goods, trade ornaments specifically, following the appearance of Europeans <!-- add citation to that previous investigation -->, hinting at the emergence of social inequality in the Indigenous community. Here we have examined ceramic vessel shape standardization to measure craft specialization as a proxy for social differentiation, such as elite control [@Costin2001; @Junker1999]. Our results indicate that differences in pottery shape can be detected using EFA. The result of our MANOVA test shows there is a significant difference in shapes between the pre-European and Post-European periods, and between the pre-European and the Chinese periods. The average shape presents a round body with a wider rim and neck before European contact, and turns to a more oval-shaped body with narrower rim and neck after the European presence. These changes even more pronounced during the Chinese contact period. In general, pottery vessels become shorter in height over time, that leading to an oval-shaped body. 

Our CV tests indicates that there are significant differences in shape standardisation between the pre-European period and post-European period, and between the Chinese contact and either pre-European or post-European periods. This suggests pottery shape became more homogeneous and standardized after foreign contacts with European colonizers and even moreso after contact with Chinese immigrants. Compositional analysis shows that the clay pastes are similar, regardless of the increasing standardization of the pottery shape, reflecting continuity in the raw material sources. We can thus rule out changes in clay fabric as a factor in changes in vessel shape. To determine if shape changes might be related to changes in the function of pots at Kiwulan, we attempted to identify lipids trapped in the fabric of potsherds to identify foods that may have contributed residues absorbed into the clay <!-- add citation of work that we are trying to follow here, eg. Seung's paper in JIPA -->. Unfortunately, we did not obtain useful results due to very low lipid yields, which might result from the very thin, dense, and low porosity fabric of rhte Kiwulan pottery. These physical characteristics of the clay offers limited spaces to trap and protect organic molecules from microbiological degradation [cf. @Evershed2008, pp. 909].

Our results support the hypothesis that foreign influences at Kiwulan influenced emergence of social inequality in the local Indigenous society. We find that , stronger in the Chinese period instead of the European period originally thought to be. The hypothesis of the emergence of social inequality based on the monopolies for long-distance trade brought by the Europeans was not fully supported. The nature and context of the interaction with the foreign presences might give an insight into the different degrees of standardized pottery. Compared to other region in Taiwan, the European colonial control was weak in Yilan due to the relatively isolated location by mountains and the economic consideration of the Spanish and the Dutch who prefer northern Taiwan as a trading base. Yilan could be seen as a place experienced indirect influences by the European trade network and their colonial activities in a pericolonial context [cf. @Acabado2017]. On the contrary, the interaction between indigenous people and the Chinese in the 19th century was more intense and direct since those Chinese immigrants settled in Yilan and lived closely with indigenous societies. This direct influence is reflected by the archaeological evidence of a large amount of Chinese porcelains and distinctive architectural bricks and tiles used by Chinese [@Hsieh2009]. Also, the finding of adoption of coffin in mortuary practice that viewed as an ethnic symbol for Chinese was observed [@Chen2007]. 

More standardized pottery shape without controlling the clay paste or technology suggests the shape as a preferred characteristic in pottery production during the Chinese period. However, the standardization is not reflected by most metric attributes. There is higher variation in thickness attributes compared to diameter attributes, indicating shape is the main attribute that presents homogeneity. In addition to the emergence of specialized groups indicative of changes in social organization, a further explanation could be that producing homogeneous pottery is an act of resistance to the Europeans intrusion and the Chinese immigrants by emphasizing the practice of traditional pottery production. In a culture contact situation, social identity could be expressed through materials practices to show cultural homogeneity and distinction from other groups [@Voss2005]. It is also important to recognize that social identity might be more complicated in a colonial context, not just a colonized–colonizer or local/foreign dichotomy [@Voss2005; @Voss2008]. The case study of Shamaoshan cemetery (3BC- 4AD) in Southwest China showing the process of incorporation of Southwest China into the Han Empire involved a century of conflicts, resistance, and acceptance among social groups with different identities, especially in the historical context of Han immigrants [@Wu2019]. At Kiwulan, the standardization of potter shape is significant in the 19th century when a a large number of Chinese immigrants migrated to Yilan. Shape can be viewed as a symbol as an expression the indigenous identity or social boundary because shape is the most obvious and visible trait compared with other features of pottery [cf. @Roux2015]. Although there is an increase in number of imported ceramics over time and reached high quantity and diversity in the 19th century, the production of the local pottery continued and became more standardized. This might imply not only the utilitarian function, but an deliberate action to emphasize the pottery tradition as their cultural custom. 

# Conclusion

This case study demonstrates the application of Elliptic Fourier analysis on ceramic shapes to explore the emergence of ceramic specialization and the underlying mechanism indicative of foreign cultural influences. Compared with the traditional linear measurement approach, geometric morphometrics methods especially EFA-based outline approach is more effective to detect shape variations for artifact shape without obvious landmarks. Here, EFA approach combined with a significance test for the equality of CVs for shape variables provides a robust way to identify and statistically assess the difference in shape standardization. Lower variation in ceramic shape was identified after the European presence and even much lower variation during the Chinese presence. The direct relationship between foreign influences and highly standardized ceramic shape was tested here on Kiwulan pottery. This finding helps to understand the cause and factor that would lead to the standardization of pottery production in a cross-cultural interaction context. This gave an insight into the discussion of ceramic specialization which is usually associated with the changes in social organization. The more homogeneous shape during the contact period without any changes in clay paste or producing technique suggests that shape standardization is an outcome resulted from an intentional act. The results here suggest an expression of social identity or showing cultural boundaries in indigenous societies through visible variables when encountering foreign intrusion. The analysis allows comparisons between sites with a similar historical trajectory in a pericolonial context. Our case study includes an openly available pipeline suitable for other assemblages, ensuring reproducibility and expanding the use of shape-based quantitative methods to questions about craft specialization and standardization in prehistoric technologies.
